                  Hello! I see that you have found my page.. Well I am glad that you are here to find out more about me!
                  My name is Christopher Nguyen, and I was born on November 26, 1997. I love to use the computer and play games but I also love to fiddle around with the inspect element tool on Google.. 
                  Although I was a in the midst of studying in the medical field before-hand, I was enjoying myself quite a bit before I could no longer afford to stay in the program.
                  I was forced to drop from the program because I was offered no financial help from the school (they asked if I had cash to use). But here I am today, learning about programming in hopes to become a software engineer in the future.
                  I have very little background in this field; I have previously taken a CIS class where I was able to learn about HTML and other useless things that don't matter in coding. 
                  In hopes of my dream, I wish to learn a lot in this program I am apart of in hopes to transferring my skills to a big company! 
                  A boy can only dream!
                </p>
